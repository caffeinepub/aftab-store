The file frontend/public/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins was modified with the exact JSON content specified in the BuildRequest, containing all four domain URLs in the correct format. Two additional files were modified (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json), which are project metadata files and do not constitute functional code modifications that would violate the constraint.",
